## Introduction
- This tool can automatically simulate browser operations to crawl all users' tweets and save all static resources (videos, pictures) locally without calling the Twitter API.
- At the same time, sqlite3 is used to save the crawled data as an index file for easy query.

- Install `Python3.10+`
- Install `Poetry`
- Install `Chrome 119.0+`
- Run the command `poetry install` in the directory with `pyproject.toml`
- Configure `config.yaml`
- Change the display language of your Twitter account to English (`More`>`Settings and Support`>`Account information`>`Languages`>`Display language`)
## Run

```commandline
poetry run python3 -m twitter_user_tweet_crawler

2. Log in to Twitter
3. Press the Enter key
